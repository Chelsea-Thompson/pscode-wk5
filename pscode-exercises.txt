// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

print(x+y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number % 2 = 0 print even 
else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask the user to input 5 numbers
	read n1, n2, n3, n4 ,n5

average = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 
	print average

if(n1>n2)
	set min to n2
else
	set min to n1
if(n3<min)
	set min to n3
if(n4<min)
	set min to n4
if(n5<min)
	set min to n5
print min

if(n1<n2)
	set max to n2
else 
	set max to n1
if(n3>max)
	set max to n3
if(n4>max)
	set max to n4
if(n5>max)
	set max to n5
print max
